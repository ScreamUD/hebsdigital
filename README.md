**My notices**
- If use `grunt/gulp` could `minify` all css

- If use `SASS/LESS` could make more better module structure for each part of page

- If use `SASS/LESS` could make `mixins` which provide us keep the code in one place (e.g. `box-shadow` can get parameters for all four positions via `function` like I have done there `https://github.com/ScreamUD/wrg-test/blob/master/scss/mixins/_personale_mixins.scss`)

- If use some `templater` (e.g. `jade`), can achieve more better file structure for each block and each page in general  

- Can use some `lints` for js, css, html. Example of how I have done it you can find there `https://github.com/ScreamUD/wrg-test`
